# Ada Loop Exit Handling Bug

This example demonstrates a potential issue with the `exit` statement in Ada loops.  Improperly handling loop exits can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors, especially in larger programs.

The provided `bug.ada` file shows an example of a loop that exits prematurely.  The solution, `bugSolution.ada`, demonstrates safer ways to handle such situations.

This repository serves as a simple illustration of a common Ada coding pitfall and highlights strategies for preventing related issues.
